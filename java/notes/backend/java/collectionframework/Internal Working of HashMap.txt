HashMap : 
	A HashMap is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It's based on the concept of hashing, which provides efficient insertion, search, and deletion operations.

Key Components :
	. Key: The unique identifier for a value.
	. Value: The data associated with a key.
	. Bucket Array: An array of linked lists.
	. Hash Function: A function that converts keys into integer indices (bucket indices).
	
	
	
Internal Working of HashMap : 
----------------------------

HashMap<String, String> hashMap = new HashMap<>();
hashMap.put("KEY", "Value") : ("key" : must be an object, It can't be primitive data type.)

	1. create bucket :
	------------------

		. In the heap memory JVM will create 16 buckets.(All the java object are created in heap memory and hashMap is also an object.)
		. hashMap uses a hash table, which is an array of buckets. 
		. Each bucket can hold a linked list of key-value pairs (Entry objects).
		
		. Heap Memory: Java objects, including HashMap instances, are created in the heap memory managed by the JVM.
		. Initial Capacity: The default initial capacity for a HashMap is typically 16 (a power of 2), but it's configurable. You can set a different initial capacity if you know the expected size of your map beforehand.
		. Hash Table: A HashMap utilizes a hash table structure, which consists of an array of buckets. Each bucket holds a linked list of key-value pairs (Entry objects).
							
			.Now lets represent bucket in computer programming language .
			The buckets form a hash table

				+-------------------+
			0	|       Bucket 1     |
				+-------------------+
				+-------------------+
			1	|       Bucket 2     |
				+-------------------+
				+-------------------+
			2	|       Bucket 3     |
				+-------------------+
				+-------------------+
			3	|       Bucket 4     |
				+-------------------+
				+-------------------+
			4	|       Bucket 5     |
				+-------------------+
				+-------------------+
			5	|       Bucket 6     |
				+-------------------+
				+-------------------+
			6	|       Bucket 7     |
				+-------------------+
				+-------------------+
			7	|       Bucket 8     |
				+-------------------+
				+-------------------+
			8	|       Bucket 9     |
				+-------------------+
				+-------------------+
			9	|       Bucket 10    |
				+-------------------+
				+-------------------+
			10	|       Bucket 11    |
				+-------------------+
				+-------------------+
			11	|       Bucket 12    |
				+-------------------+
				+-------------------+
			12	|       Bucket 13    |
				+-------------------+
				+-------------------+
			13	|       Bucket 14    |
				+-------------------+
				+-------------------+
			14	|       Bucket 15    |
				+-------------------+
				+-------------------+
			15	|       Bucket 16    |
				+-------------------+
				
			
		

	1. Find hashCode : 
	------------------
		At first JVM will get the hash code value of key using the hashCode() method of Hashing.
		hashCode() method is come from Object class so that we can not use primitive types as key.
			
			"KEY".hashCode(); // == hash code value
			
			"FB".hashCode(); // == 2236
			"LD".hashCode(); // == 2424
			
				+------------+
				|P 	|2236|N  | ---->
				+------------+ 
				
				+------------+
				|P 	|2424|N  | ---->
				+------------+ 
				
		Hashing: 
		--------
			When a key-value pair is inserted, the hash function(convert large value into smaller value) calculates a hash code(integer value generated from a key, used for indexing) based on the key. 
			This hash code is then used to determine the bucket index where the pair will be stored.
			Should be work in O(1) or O(length) for string. But O(length) not preffered.
			
			h(input) = output
			h(input) = output1 // never happen
			h(input) = output
			h(input1) = output/output1 // can have same/different output for different input 
			
			
			. For integer key : 
				weighted sum : h(key) = key % m  
				//where m is a prime number. If you're using a hash table, m is often chosen to be the size of the hash table.
			
			. For String keys : 
				weighted sum : h("key") = (ASC[0]*x⁰ + ASC[1]*x¹ + ASC[2]*x²) / m
			
			. For object keys : weighted sum : 
				Simple Sum : Add the hash codes of all significant fields.
					h(object) = hash(field1) + hash(field2) + ... + hash(fieldN)
				Weighted Sum : Assign weights to different fields based on their importance.
					h(object) = weight1 * hash(field1) + weight2 * hash(field2) + ... + weightN * hash(fieldN)
				XOR-Based Combination : Combine hash codes using XOR for better distribution.
					h(object) = hash(field1) ^ hash(field2) ^ ... ^ hash(fieldN)
					
					
			
		.Load Factor :
			If HashMap reaches more than 75%(Bucket 12) of it's capacity then it double the existing capacity(ie. 32).
			
			Load factor = 75% or 0.75 or 3/4
	
	3. Bucket Selection: 
		The calculated hash code is typically subjected to a modulo operation with the size of the bucket array to obtain the final bucket index.
		
		find bucket index :  
		---------------------------
			bucket index is the bitwise AND operation value of hashCode with (bucket size - 1).
	
			hashcode & (bucket size - 1) = bucket index
				
				. 2236 & (16-1) = 12
					
					Let's convert 2236 and 15 to binary:
						2236 = 10001101100
						15 = 00001111
						Performing the bitwise AND operation :

							10001101100
						& 	   00001111
							-----------
							   00001100 = 12
							-----------

				. 2424 & (16-1) = 8
	
	4. Collision Handling: 
		If multiple keys hash have the same bucket index, a collision occurs. HashMaps usually handle collisions using linked lists. The key-value pairs are stored in a linked list at that bucket index.
		
		find hash collision : 
		---------------------
			If multiple keys hash code value has the same bucket index, then this condition is known as the hash collision.
		
				"FB".hashCode() == 2236
				2236 & 15 = 12
				
				"Ea".hashCode() == 2236
				2236 & 15 = 12
				
				
				+------------+			+------------+
				|P 	|2236|N  | ---->	|P 	|2236|N  | ---->
				+------------+ 			+------------+ 
		
	5. If there is no hash collision : 
		Simply add hash code value to bucket(LinkedList) as first node at there bucket index.
		
				"FB".hashCode(); // == 2236
				2236 & 15 = 12
				
					+------------+
				12	|P 	|2236|N  | ---->
					+------------+ 
					
				"LD".hashCode(); // 2424
				2424 & (16-1) = 8
				
					+------------+
				8	|P 	|2236|N  | ---->
					+------------+ 
	
	
	6. If there is hash collision : 
		Compare the key with existing key using "key".equals("existing-key") method.
		If present keys and existing are equal then replace existing node with present node, otherwise add key to next node of that bucket index.
		
			. If key is already present : 
		
				"FB".hashCode() == 2236
				2236 & 15 = 12
				
				"FB".hashCode() == 2236
				2236 & 15 = 12
				
				
					+------------+
				12	|P|2236(FB)|N| ---->
					+------------+ 
					
					+------------+
				12	|P|2236(FB)|N| ---->
					+------------+ 
					
			. If key is not present already :
			
				"FB".hashCode() == 2236
				2236 & 15 = 12
				
				"Ea".hashCode() == 2236
				2236 & 15 = 12
				
					+------------+			+------------+
				12	|P|2236(FB)|N| ---->	|P|2236(Ea)|N| ---->
					+------------+ 			+------------+ 
		
	
	5. Retrieval: 
		To retrieve a value, the hash function is applied to the key to find the corresponding bucket index. The linked list at that index is then traversed to find the key-value pair
		
		Searching in Linked List: 
			We have to traverse the list one by one from the begning in Linked List.
			And that is the only drawback of the LinkedList because it reduces the performance.
			
		map.get("key") : traversing is very fast for hash map because of time complexity is O(1).
		----------------
			. map.get("Ea");
				step-1. HashCode of Ea = 2236
				step-2. Find bucket index = 12
				step-3. Goto bucket index(12) and get the key-value pair.:
					Ideally one bucket contains one node but due to collision bucket has multiple node which reduces performance. That's why hashMap is inhanced in java8 using TREEIFY_THRESHOLD.
					
					TREEIFY_THRESHOLD : If there is more than 8 nodes in a bucket then HahMap is reached to TREEIFY_THRESHOLD.Now change the LinkedList implementation with self balancing tree(O() -> log1+len(len)). JVM uses compareTo() method to check the order of items.
					
					. tree is also called red-black tree or binary search tree or self balancing tree.
					
				step-4. retun value.

HashMap vs Hashtable in Java : 
	HashMap and Hashtable are both implementations of the Map interface in Java, used for storing key-value pairs.
	
	. HashMap: 
		. Not synchronized, which means it's faster but not thread-safe. It's suitable for single-threaded environments or when you explicitly handle synchronization.
		. Allows one null key and multiple null values.  
		. Generally faster due to the absence of synchronization overhead.
		. HashMap uses Iterator.
		. HashMap inherits from AbstractMap.
	
	. Hashtable: 
		. Synchronized, making it thread-safe but slower compared to HashMap. It's suitable for multi-threaded environments where thread safety is a priority. 
		. Doesn't allow null keys or values.
		. Slower due to the synchronization overhead.
		. Hashtable uses Enumerator.
		. Hashtable inherits from Dictionary.
		
	Modern Recommendation:
		While Hashtable is still available, ConcurrentHashMap is generally preferred for multi-threaded scenarios due to better performance and flexibility.
