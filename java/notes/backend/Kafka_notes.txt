High Level overview :
 
 pub/sb model : 
	publisher --message/event--> message broker(kafka server) --> subscriber
	
	
	
Kafka component :

Producer : publisher is Producer.
Consumer : subscriber is Consumer.
Broker : Kafka broker is nothing but just a server. In simple word, A broker is just an intermediate entity that helps in message exchanges between a producer and a consumer.
Cluster : There can be one or more brokers in the Kafka Cluster(broker1+broker2+broker3+... = Kafka Cluster)
Topic : It specifies the category of the message or the classification of the message. Listeners can then just respond to the messsages that belongs the topics they are listening on.(Topic are just like database table)
Partition : If any partion goes off the others partion are available to handle the load without any downtime. It increases perfoformance.
Offset : In Kafka, the sequence no is assigned to each messages in each partion of a kafka topic are called Offsets.
Consumer Groups : Consumer1+Consumer2+Consumer3+... = Consumer Groups

Zookeeper : Zookeeper is a prerequisite for Kafka. Kafka is a distributed system, and it uses Zookeeper for coordination and to track the status of Kafka cluster nodes. It also keeps track of Kafka topics, partions, etc.
