Design Patterns :
=================

	1. Creational Patterns
	----------------------
		These patterns concern the creation of objects in a flexible way.
		. Factory Method:
		----------
			Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
		. Abstract Factory:
		----------
			Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.   
		. Builder:
		----------
			Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.		
		. Prototype:
		----------
			Creates new objects by copying existing objects.
		. Singleton:
		----------
			Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
	
	2. Structural Patterns
	----------------------
		These patterns deal with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.
		. Adapter:
		----------
			Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.		
		. Decorator:
		----------
			Add additional responsibilities to an object dynamically without affecting its existing behavior.
		. Proxy:
		----------
			Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.		
		. Facade:
		----------
			Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.		
		. Composite:
		----------
			Composes objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.		
		. Flyweight:
		----------
			Uses sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.
	
	3. Behavioral Patterns
	----------------------
		These patterns are concerned with the interaction and assignment of responsibilities between objects.
		. Observer:
		----------
			Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.   
		. Strategy:
		----------
			Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
		. Template Method:
		----------
			Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses.
		. Command:
		----------
			Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.   
		. Iterator:
		----------
			Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its internal representation.   
		. Mediator:
		----------
			Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
		. Memento:
		----------
			Captures an object's internal state so that it can be restored to that state later.
		. State:
		----------
			Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
		. Visitor:
		----------
			Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure.
		. Saga Design Pattern :
		-----------------------
			Saga Design Pattern is a strategy used in distributed systems to manage long-running transactions and ensure data consistency in a microservices architecture. It is particularly useful when a single transaction spans multiple microservices, making it impractical to use traditional two-phase commit protocols due to scalability, performance, or reliability concerns.
			
			Example Use Case: E-commerce Order Processing
				Step 1: Create an order (Order Service).
				Step 2: Reserve inventory (Inventory Service).
				Step 3: Process payment (Payment Service).
				
				Failure Scenario:
					If payment fails, compensate by releasing the reserved inventory and canceling the order.

		Key Concepts
		-------------
			. Saga: A sequence of transactions (or steps) that are executed in a distributed system to achieve a business goal.
			. Compensation: If a step fails, compensating actions are executed to undo the changes made by the previous successful steps.
			. Atomicity: Instead of enforcing strict atomicity at the system level, the Saga ensures that the overall workflow eventually reaches a consistent state.
			
		Types of Saga Patterns :
		------------------------
			2. Choreography:
			----------------
				Each service performs its step and publishes events that trigger subsequent steps in other services.
				Decentralized approach: no central controller.
				Suitable for simpler workflows.
				
				Example:
					Order service places an order and emits an "Order Created" event.
					Payment service listens for this event, processes the payment, and emits a "Payment Completed" event.
					Inventory service updates the stock and emits a "Stock Updated" event.

			1. Orchestration:
			-----------------
				A central orchestrator service coordinates the workflow by invoking each step in sequence.
				Centralized approach: the orchestrator manages the logic and state of the Saga.
				Suitable for complex workflows.
				
				Example:
					. An Orchestrator service calls the Order service to create an order.
					. If successful, it calls the Payment service to process payment.
					. If any step fails, the orchestrator triggers compensating transactions (e.g., cancel the order).

Design Principles :
===================

SOLID Design Principles : 
	SOLID is an acronym(a word formed from the initial letters of the several words) for five fundamental principles of object-oriented design (OOD). These principles help in creating software designs that are easy to understand, maintain, and extend.
	
	1. SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) :
		. A class should have only one reason to change.
		. This principle suggests that a class should have a single, well-defined responsibility. By adhering to SRP, you make your classes more focused, testable, and reusable.	
			
			@Data
			class Employee {
				private String name;
				private int salary;
			}
			
			class EmployeeReportGenerator {
				public void generateReport(Employee employee) {
					// Generate report logic
				}
			}
			
			In this example, the Employee class is responsible for employee data, while the EmployeeReportGenerator class is responsible for generating reports. This separation of concerns adheres to SRP.
	
	2. OCP (Open-Closed Principle) : 
		. Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
		. This principle states that you should be able to extend a class's behavior without modifying its source code. This is achieved through inheritance and polymorphism. 
		
			abstract class Shape {
				abstract double calculateArea();
			}

			class Rectangle extends Shape {
				private double width;
				private double height;

				// ... constructors and getters/setters

				@Override
				double calculateArea() {
					return width * height;
				}
			}

			class Circle extends Shape {
				private double radius;

				// ... constructors and getters/setters

				@Override
				double calculateArea() {
					return Math.PI * radius * radius;
				}
			}
			
			New shapes can be added by creating new subclasses without modifying the Shape class. This adheres to OCP.
		
		
	
	3. LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle) :
		. Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
		. This principle states that derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes. In other words, a function that uses a base class must be able to use any of its subclasses without knowing it.
		
			class Bird {
				public void fly() {
					System.out.println("I am flying");
				}
			}

			class Penguin extends Bird {
				@Override
				public void fly() {
					// Penguins cannot fly
					throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
				}
			}
			
		In this example, Penguin violates LSP because it cannot substitute for Bird in all cases. A better approach would be to create an AquaticBird interface and implement it for Penguin.
			
			interface FlyingBird {
				void fly();
			}

			interface AquaticBird {
				void swim();
			}

			class Sparrow implements FlyingBird {
				@Override
				public void fly() {
					System.out.println("I am flying");
				}
			}

			class Penguin implements AquaticBird {
				@Override
				public void swim() {
					System.out.println("I am swimming");
				}
			}

	
	4. ISP (Interface Segregation Principle) :
		. Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
		. This principle suggests that large interfaces should be split into smaller, more specific interfaces. This improves code flexibility and reusability.
		
			interface Shape {
				double calculateArea();
				void draw();
			}

			interface Resizable {
				void resize(double factor);
			}

			class Rectangle implements Shape, Resizable {
				// ... implementation
			}

			class Circle implements Shape {
				// ... implementation
			}
			
			In this example, Rectangle implements both Shape and Resizable, while Circle only implements Shape. This adheres to ISP.
	
	5. DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle) :
		. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.   
		. This principle suggests that you should depend on abstractions, not concretions. This promotes loose coupling and makes your code more flexible.
		
			interface Database {
				void connect();
				void disconnect();
			}

			class MySQLDatabase implements Database {
				// ... implementation
			}

			class Application {
				private Database database;

				public Application(Database database) {
					this.database = database;
				}

				public void useDatabase() {
					database.connect();
					// ... use database
					database.disconnect();
				}
			}
			
			In this example, the Application class depends on the Database interface, not a specific implementation. This allows you to easily switch databases without modifying the Application class.
