enum (short for "enumeration") is a special data type in programming that represents a collection of named values. These values are typically constants, and enum is used to define a variable that can hold only one of the predefined constants.

Key Points:
enum Day defines an enumeration with the constants SUNDAY, MONDAY, etc.
The switch statement shows how to use an enum in decision-making.
The values() method returns an array of all constants in the enum, allowing you to iterate through them.
