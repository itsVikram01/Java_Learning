volatile keyword :
------------------
    . When you declare a variable as volatile, you’re telling the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that this variable can be accessed and modified by multiple threads.
    . Changes made to this variable by one thread are immediately visible to other threads. No more hiding in caches or secret corners—everyone gets to see the latest value.
    . Use volatile when you care more about visibility than atomicity.
