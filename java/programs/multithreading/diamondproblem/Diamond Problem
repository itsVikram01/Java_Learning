Notes :
-------
    Java does not  support multiple inheritance for classes due to Complexity and ambiguity.

    Diamond problem :
    -----------------
        subclass can inherit from multiple parent classes.
        If both parent classes have methods with the same name then this can lead to ambiguity.
        The compiler wouldn't know which method to call from the subclass.
        This is often referred to as the "diamond problem".
