. Transient Keyword: Fields marked as transient are not serialized.
    . When you mark a variable as transient, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) knows to exclude it from the serialization process.
    . The value of a transient variable won’t be saved in the serialized form of the object. Instead, it’ll be ignored during serialization and deserialization.


    Example with Transient Field -
    ----------------------------
        public class Employee implements Serializable {
            private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

            private String name;
            private int age;
            private transient String password; // this field will not be serialized

            public Employee(String name, int age, String password) {
                this.name = name;
                this.age = age;
                this.password = password;
            }

            @Override
            public String toString() {
                return "Employee [name=" + name + ", age=" + age + ", password=" + password + "]";
            }
        }
